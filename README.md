### Requirements
Node.js (version 16 or higher)
npm or yarn (depending on the package manager you prefer)

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using git:

      git clone https://github.com/Anca2022/BPIT-challenge.git

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies:

      cd <project-directory>
      npm install

      Or if you're using Yarn: yarn install

This will install all the necessary packages, including React, TypeScript, Vite, and other dependencies defined in package.json.

3. Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

      npm run dev

      Or with Yarn: yarn dev

This will start the Vite development server and open the app in your browser. By default, it will be available at http://localhost:5173.

4. Build for Production
To build the project for production, run the following command:

      npm run build
   
      Or with Yarn: yarn build

This will create a dist/ folder with the optimized production build of your app.

5. Test the Production Build Locally
To preview the production build locally, you can run:

      npm run preview

      Or with Yarn: yarn preview
   
This will serve the production build at a local server (usually on http://localhost:5173).
